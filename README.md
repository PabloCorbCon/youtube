# Pablo Corbal√°n - youtube

---

In this repository I'm going to **share all the code from my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYawvF7GUx2eo2QUbtfdtAg)** 
divided into folders depending on the video. 

I have decided to create a **single repository** to avoid having dozens of repositories each with a few rows of code.
In each of the folders you will find a `README.md` file. in which the purpose of that folder is explained; along with links to the corresponding videos.

I invite you to stop by the YouTube channel to say hello and subscribe if you like it. If you have found any error in 
this repository, in the code of any of the videos; feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/pblcc/youtube/issues)
on GitHub.

Some of my YouTube videos are in spanish, **all the content I've created in Spanish is inside the** [es/](es/) **folder.** 

All the projects are under the MIT [License](LICENSE), except otherwhise is expecified.
